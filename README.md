## Setup and Deployment

### Local Development
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. No additional setup required as it runs entirely client-side

### GitHub Pages Deployment
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload all project files to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Set source to main branch
5. The application will be available at `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]`

## Usage

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Development Notes

This implementation uses sessionStorage for data persistence, which means:
- Data will persist during the browser session but will be cleared when the browser is closed
- For a production environment, this would need to be connected to a proper backend API
- The current implementation includes simulated authentication and data handling

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with Google Scholar API for automatic publication tracking
- Database backend for persistent data storage
- Email notifications for submission updates
- Advanced reporting and analytics features
- Integration with institutional systems
